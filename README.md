Key takeaways:
I have learned and reviewed basic Javascript syntax, functions and operations. I have also learned differences of global, function, and block scopes.
Where in the global scope, it can be accessed globally and by any function, while function-scope variables can only be accessed within the function only. Lastly, in block scope we can only use it in certain code blocks like for loops.
